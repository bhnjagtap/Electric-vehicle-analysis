# Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard provides comprehensive analysis and visualization of the electric vehicle (EV) population data, focusing on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). The dashboard includes insights such as vehicle model year distribution, sales trends over the years, fuel consumption comparisons, and detailed vehicle analysis.

## Dashboard Overview

- **BEV vs PHEV Analysis**: A comparison of the distribution and trends of BEVs and PHEVs in the dataset.
- **Model Year Distribution**: Visualization of the number of electric vehicles by their model years.
- **Sales Trends**: Trend analysis of electric vehicle sales over the years.
- **Fuel Consumption Comparison**: Comparative analysis of fuel consumption between BEVs and PHEVs.
- **Detailed Vehicle Analysis**: Insights into various parameters of electric vehicles in a single dashboard.

## Dataset

The dashboard is built using recent electric vehicle population dataset. The dataset contains information on BEVs, PHEVs, their model years, sales data, and fuel consumption metrics.

## Usage
